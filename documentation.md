### Software

- Node.js
  
  Javascript has multiple modified versions of the interpreter. Node.js is one of them and is specifically suitable for web servers. It can replace most functions of PHP.

- PHP (avoid to use)
  
  Dynamically generate HTML. It is the worst programming language in the world.

- WordPress (maybe not)
  
  A blog managing system (now used for any webpage management) based on PHP and SQL. Its functions include:
  
  - Quick design
  
  - Content management
    
    Usually for static content such as blogs. Not very suitable for us.
  
  - Various plug-ins

- MongoDB
  
  The main database for the timeline. 

- Some DB Manager
  
  Not decided yet. We want it to provide simple interfaces for JS to edit, fetch, add, delete, and propose the data. If the MongoDB itself is good enough, we will not need this.
